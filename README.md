# Intelligent_Pirate_Game
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project I had created an intelligent agent to play a maze game where reaching the treasure is how you won.
I was given the structure and rules of the game and how to play which was only using the arrow keys. I was tasked with being able to make pirates.
reach the treasure as quickly as possible. I was to make sure that the pirate remembered the moves that gave it the best rewards and
where it should move in the next turn based on the current position and rules of the game. For example, it cannot make an 
illegal move of going off the map. Once the pirate had passed the threshold of the winning ratio then the pirate agent will pass the completion check
and given the go ahead to play a game to test its ability and show it off to the user.


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist in the field of AI is bringing new technology to the table and allowing not just the world of technology to prosper but also other fields like
biology, chemistry, astronomy, and much more. They help give us the tools needed to breakthrough barriers we have in each of the respective fields.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
It’s important to think creatively as each situation will need the AI to be trained but not necessarily in the same manner as others. You will need to be able to know.
how this AI will learn and what is the best way it can digest this information quickly as computers will need to run through info many times before being able to reach an 
acceptable level created for the task. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Since AI can run on its own with very little human intervention it’s important to note the limitations we need in place. Data used to train the AI should not be kept if not needed.
and the people who have access should be very limited if at all. Data privacy is one of the biggest things we owe to the end user but also to keep the organization in
compliance with the law. The GDPR is a collection of regulations that all software companies must oblige to if they wish to be able to continue business within its borders.
